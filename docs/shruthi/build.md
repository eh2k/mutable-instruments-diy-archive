This section contains all the information allowing you to build your own Shruthi or hack its firmware.

The Shruthi contains two section: a digital section ("control board" or "digital board"), containing the display, main microcontroller, switches and pots ; and an analog section ("filter board") hosting the VCF, VCA, input mixer and the output stage. Several variants of the filter board are available to provide a broad range of sounds.

### Control board

-   [Schematics, BOM, and assembly instructions for the control board](../digital).
-   [Schematics, BOM, and assembly instructions for the XT control board](../digital_xt).
-   [Firmware](../firmware).

### Filter board

-   [SMR4 mkII](../smr4mkii), a solid, Roland-ish, 4-pole filter.
-   [LP2+Delay](../delay), the combination of a MS-20 LPF and a low-fi digital delay.
-   [4-Pole Mission](../4pm), a 4-pole multimode filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander.
-   [Dual SVF](../svf2), the combination of two multimode 2-pole filters - in series or parallel.
-   [Polivoks filter](../polivoks).
-   [FX/Digital filter board](../dsp) - a nasty, crunchy, digital LPF/HPF and FX section.
-   [SMR4 filter board](../smr4) (predecessor of the SMR4 mkII).

Mutable Instruments has stopped publishing any information regarding the use of "vintage" SSM/CEM/IR integrated circuits.

### Special editions

To celebrate the launch of new filter boards, limited edition series of kits have been sold.

-   Assembly notes for the [4-Pole Mission](../4pm_build) special edition.
-   Assembly notes for the [Yellow Magic](../ym_build) special edition.
-   Filter board assembly for the [Midnight](../svf2) special edition (the [control board](../digital) is standard).

### Enclosure

-   [Blueprint](../static/drawings//blueprint.pdf) with 3D parts placement by [nio101](http://tenuki.fr/nio101/)
-   A [Sketchup export](../static/drawings//nio_model.skp) of nio101's 3D model
-   [SVG file](../static/drawings//enclosure.svg) for the acrylic case.
-   [Image](../static/drawings//paisley.tif) of the Paisley pattern engraved by default on the cases.
