Compatibility
-------------

The CVpal is class-compliant but uses an unusual USB setting (1ms poll-rate in low-speed mode) not well supported on Windows. Optimal latency is obtained with OS X &gt;= 10.6.3 ; iOS ; or Linux &gt;= 2.6. On other systems, the CVpal will work but messages will be delayed by up to 8ms.

Conversion modes
----------------

-   Monophonic with velocity
-   Monophonic with velocity and square oscillator
-   Dual monophonic
-   Duophonic
-   CC conversion
-   Monophonic with CC
-   Quad triggers
-   Quad gates
-   Monophonic with MIDI clock output

Technical characteristics
-------------------------

Range and standards:

-   CV outputs: 0 to 4V, V/Oct (4 octaves).
-   Gate outputs: Positive V-trig, ON = 5V ; OFF = 0V.

Performance:

-   Resolution: &lt; 2mV.
-   8 points calibration curve for non-linearity compensation.
-   Temperature dependency: +/- 2 cents within the 10° C to 80° C range.
-   Output impedance: 220Ω (rule of thumb: 2 cents drop per connection to a CV input).

Power supply: USB-bus powered, current draw &lt; 20mA.
