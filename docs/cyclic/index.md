CycliC is a novel step sequencer concept, with six independent
subsequences that cycle through a 32-note array, developed as a
collaboration between [Defective Records
Software](http://defectiverecords.com/) and Mutable
Instruments.

-   32 steps array, with per-step note, gate length, velocity, and two
    CC values
-   6 channels, each of them traversing a subset of the 32 steps - with
    offset/length/stride control
-   internal or MIDI clock
-   MIDI or VST plugin output (up to 3 plugins)
-   MIDI CC control of almost all parameters, including easy to use MIDI
    learn feature
-   20 presets, controllable by mouse or MIDI program change, can be
    saved to disk
-   event randomization (note value, location, velocity, CC values)
-   note constraint to user selectable scale
-   adjustable GUI size
